DlgBookGuardsman01=This is the guard's personal log.
DlgBookGuardsman02=14.5. 17 o'clock:|Nothing happened. No menace from the east.
DlgBookGuardsman03=15.5. 17 o'clock:|Again no attacks.
DlgBookGuardsman04=16.5. 16 o'clock:|Since nobody is attacking I ended my shift earlier today.
DlgBookGuardsman05=Personal comment:|Since the elevator was blocked|there is no threat from the east anymore.
DlgBookGuardsman06=It seems that the bush men will never again attack us.
DlgBookGuardsman07=These are bad times for a soldier.
DlgBookGuardsman08=17.5. 17 o'clock|If it had not been for this earthquake...

DlgBookMhoram01=The diary of a so-called Mhoram.
DlgBookMhoram02=798|''t is a bad year.'|The harvest is rotting.|The stock is dying.
DlgBookMhoram03=799|'Finally some hope'|War against the bushmen has ended.
DlgBookMhoram04=800|'A life in peace'|The bushmen are nice people and help us with repairs.|Everyone here is living prosperous.
DlgBookMhoram05=802|'Contract'|We signed a peace contract with the bushmen.|Only our guard does not agree.
DlgBookMhoram06=803|'Mysterious happenings'|For an unknown reason the bushmen are not visiting us anymore...
DlgBookMhoram07=...earlier they visited quite often.|We only found one badly wounded bushman, he wanted to tell us something...
DlgBookMhoram08=...he stuttered about something big, a giant maybe.|Only few of his kind had survived.
DlgBookMhoram09=804|I will have to travel east.|We are expecting earthquakes, but I have to see for myself what happened.
DlgBookMhoram10=The diary ends here.

DlgBookMystery01=The whole book contains only one sentence:
DlgBookMystery02=Honk gonc vingil gheshnec imatril.
DlgBookMystery03=I hope that I pronounced that correctly.

DlgBookSongs01=This is a book with lyrics.
DlgBookSongs02=The first song goes like this:
DlgBookSongs03=The world was young, the mountains green,|When the moon still had a spotless shine,|Neither hill nor valley, neither soil nor stream|had yet a name, in Jan's time.
DlgBookSongs04=He tamed and named every thing,|Drank the first drink from the spring|And in his mirror, it is told,|he saw brilliant stars, gems and gold,
DlgBookSongs05=Saw on his had a mighty crown|and his face was full of frown.
DlgBookSongs06=The book continues like this forever.

DlgBeggar01=Hello.

DlgClonkarabas01=CLONKARABAS??? I thought I killed you???
DlgClonkarabas02=A car nearly hit you, too.
DlgClonkarabas03=So, a short moment before my certain death I was shifted to this land.
DlgClonkarabas04=Does this mean that you are the one the sorcerer mentioned?
DlgClonkarabas05=No, there is another man.|Maybe he could bring you home.
DlgClonkarabas06=On the other hand, I am a little resentful.|You shall never reach this person.
DlgClonkarabas07=This is the punishment for nearly killing me!|You will stay here forever.

DlgDoctor01=Hello? Are you awake again?
DlgDoctor02=Where am I?
DlgDoctor03=You live.
DlgDoctor04=Quite the luck you got there.|It is a miracle that you survived|the crash without any trauma.
DlgDoctor05=You were in a coma for about 10 minutes.
DlgDoctor06=What? Ony 10 minutes?
DlgDoctor07=I... had...a strange...dream.
DlgDoctor08=Where is my red pullover?

DlgDoorCastle=Hmm, this is closed...

DlgDoorShop01=The merchant is happy, |I have the eye patch|No reason to go back in there.
DlgDoorShop02=A clothes shop.|It is closed.
DlgDoorShop03=Maybe I can pry the door open with a tool?
DlgDoorShop04=Now the door is open.|Well, the end justifies the means.
DlgDoorShop05=I do not need new clothes now.|It is all but a dream!

DlgGuardsmanA02=Hello. What do you want?|Civilians have no business here.
DlgGuardsmanA03=Actually, I do have business here.
DlgGuardsmanA04=I am looking for a way to go east.
DlgGuardsmanA05=I was told that maybe|you could help me.
DlgGuardsmanA06=Then I am sure you also were told,|that no one went to the other side of the mountain|for a long long time now?
DlgGuardsmanA07=In the old days we travelled to the east regularly,|but then the elevator got buried,|and now it is blocked, so we cannot go up anymore.
DlgGuardsmanA08=It is blocked you say?
DlgGuardsmanA09=Indeed!
DlgGuardsmanA10=Then we have to blast the rubble.
DlgGuardsmanA11=Mmmm... You are right of course.|With a bomb arrow, for example.
DlgGuardsmanA12=There is only one archer in our village,|he is called Iolo.

DlgGuardsmanB01=Hello there.|I would like to get a bomb arrow|from the castle.
DlgGuardsmanB02=Unfortunately the door is closed.
DlgGuardsmanB03=And it will stay closed, because I have no weapons|that I could defend the castle with.
DlgGuardsmanB04=What if there was an attack?
DlgGuardsmanB05=The enemy could march right into the castle|and we would be at their mercy.
DlgGuardsmanB06=You should give me a T-Flint first.

DlgGuardsmanC01=Hi, guard!|Here is you T-Flint.
DlgGuardsmanC02=Very good! You may now enter the castle.
DlgGuardsmanC03=In case of an attack,|our enemy will get some T-Flints on their heads.
DlgGuardsmanC04=Hi, unfortunately I have no T-Flint for you yet.
DlgGuardsmanC05=Well, you already know...|No T-Flint, entrance.

DlgGuardsmanD01=Do you by chance have a crowbar,|so that I can enter the shop?
DlgGuardsmanD02=No, I do not have such a thing.

DlgGuardsmanE01=Hello.
DlgGuardsmanE02=Hello. What do you want?|I thought you wanted to go east.
DlgGuardsmanE03=Hello. What do you want?|Civilians have no business here.
DlgGuardsmanE04=Well, I don't quite know what I am looking for, but I...
DlgGuardsmanE05=If you don't know it, then|you should return, when you know it. 

DlgIoloA01=Do you have a bomb arrow?
DlgIoloA02=Yes, here.
DlgIoloA03=Ok, follow me then!
DlgIoloA04=Sorry, not yet.

DlgIoloB01=That's it, you can use the elevator now.
DlgIoloB02=Thanks, Iolo!

DlgIoloC01=Hey, what are you doing here?
DlgIoloC02=Come with me!
DlgIoloC03=So, once you get me some arrows we can start this thing!

DlgIoloD01=Hey, what are you doing here?
DlgIoloD02=I am just looking around.
DlgIoloD03=Get out of my room!

DlgIoloFatherA01=Do you know where Iolo is?
DlgIoloFatherA02=You want to Iolo, huh?
DlgIoloFatherA03=He just sits around in his room,|instead of working.
DlgIoloFatherA04=He is just as lazy as you look.
DlgIoloFatherA05=IOLO!!!|Come here, you slacker!
DlgIoloFatherA06=Hurry up, you stupid hack!
DlgIoloFatherA07=Today's youth...|ts,ts,ts!
DlgIoloFatherA08=What is it, father?
DlgIoloFatherA09=This guy here wants something from you!
DlgIoloFatherA10=I just wanted to ask if you would be so nice|to free the elevator...
DlgIoloFatherA11=...with a bomb arrow.
DlgIoloFatherA12=So that I can go east.|I just want to leave this dream|as fast as possible.
DlgIoloFatherA13=Of course I'll help you!|Finally something happens in this backwater town.|Finally, adventure!|It is just that I do not have any arrows.

DlgIoloFatherB01=Hello.|You do not, by chance, have a crowbar?|So that I can enter the shop?
DlgIoloFatherB02=No, ain't got none.
DlgIoloFatherB03=You start annoying me, dude.
DlgIoloFatherB04=Hello!
DlgIoloFatherB05=Go away!|Can't you greenhorn see|that I am occupied?

DlgMage02=And you saved me in times of misery.|Thanks.
DlgMage03=Are you a sorcerer?!
DlgMage04=You saved me in times of misery.|Thanks.
DlgMage05=I warned. Don't you remember the bird?
DlgMage06=You are the bird???
DlgMage07=Mhoram told me, that maybe you can tell me|how to get back to my world.
DlgMage08=Can you tell me,|how to get back to my world?
DlgMage09=I heard of that before.|There once was a man in the same situation as you.
DlgMage10=He came from the same world as you.
DlgMage11=What??? He came from my world, too???
DlgMage12=I was not able to help him. This means I cannot help you, either.
DlgMage13=However, I can guide you to him, so that he may help you.
DlgMage14=Go west then, you will find your fellow countryman.

DlgScientist03=I am talking about the one and only real world!!!
DlgScientist04=All of this is a dream.
DlgScientist05=Whether it is a dream or not you have to know for yourself.|However I happen to know the world you claim to be the real one.
DlgScientist06=I too came from there.|And, as you, I longed for returning there.
DlgScientist07=I built a machine that can bring you back.|Yet I decided to stay here.
DlgScientist08=This world is peaceful and beautiful.
DlgScientist09=You can use the machine, if you want.
DlgScientist10=Yes, of course.|Is it that one over there?
DlgScientist11=To be true:|It is not finished yet.
DlgScientist12=It needs some Tarydium.|The only deposit is guarded by a cyclops.
DlgScientist13=You will find weapons to kill it in my workshop.
DlgScientist14=Keep in mind that the cyclops has only one vulnerable spot.
DlgScientist15=I defeated the cyclops and there is Tarydium indeed.
DlgScientist16=Very well.|Put the Tarydium into the dimension vector.
DlgScientist17=You then have to fly the vehicle through a dimension rift.
DlgScientist18=Where do I get a dimension rift from?
DlgScientist19=There is a magical tome, it contains a spell|that opens such a rift.
DlgScientist20=This book is in my workshop.
DlgScientist21=In short:|Read book,|use Tarydium,|fly into the rift.

DlgTuti09=How did you get here then,|if you do not know how to go back?
DlgTuti10=I was hit by a car and I should be dead now.|Apparently, this is hell.
DlgTuti11=I do not believe that you are dead.|You look quite lively, after all.
DlgTuti12=Is there another logical explanation then?|I am not walking on mother earth anymore, so I must be dead!|Or am I dreaming?
DlgTuti13=I don't know much, maybe you should ask someone else...
DlgTuti14=That seems like a good idea.|I just want to go back home as fast as possible.

DlgIntro01=Ahh...|My head!
DlgIntro02=Why did this idiot Clonkarabas run into my car?
DlgIntro03=Crap crap crap...

SeqBirdElevator02=You will fall into misery, crow, crow...
SeqBirdElevator03=Was that a bird talking to me?
SeqBirdElevator04=I must be imagining things.

SeqBirdWarning01=It's that bird again.
SeqBirdWarning02=Looks as if it were trying to warn me.

SeqBirdRescue=The cyclops is going to kill you.|I warned you, didn't I.

SeqCyclopsAbort=The sorcerer is right,|that cyclops will kill me!

HelpGrenadeLauncherNoTarget=Here is nothing for me to fight.
